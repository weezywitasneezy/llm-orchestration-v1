Below is an example of a Technical Design Document tailored for our LLM orchestration application. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, components, data flow, error handling, security, and performance considerations. You can use this as a blueprint to guide development and communicate the design to stakeholders.

Technical Design Document: LLM Orchestration Application
1. Overview
Purpose:
 This document outlines the technical design for an LLM orchestration application. The application is a single-user, local solution designed to manage and execute workflows that interact with multiple LLM instances (via kobold.cpp). It provides a web-based interface for managing blocks (text prompts), payloads, and workflows, and displays real-time logging information.
Scope:
Frontend: A Single Page Application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Backend: An Express.js server providing RESTful API endpoints and WebSocket communication.
Database: SQLite for local storage and persistence.
Real-Time Logging: Using WebSockets to update the UI on system status and LLM interactions.

2. Architecture & Key Decisions
2.1 System Architecture
SPA with Express Backend:


The application is built as a Single Page Application.
The Express server handles API requests, manages WebSocket connections, and orchestrates communication with LLMs.
Database Management:


SQLite is used for a lightweight local database.
A dedicated module (config/db.js) manages connections, migrations, and query execution.
WebSocket Communication:


WebSockets provide real-time updates for logging, system messages, and execution progress.

getConnection(): Provide a database connection from the pool.
executeQuery(): A wrapper for executing SQL queries.
handleMigrations(): Apply database schema updates when required.

3.3 Resource Controller (controllers/resourceController.js)
Purpose:
 Manages all CRUD operations for blocks, payloads, and workflows.
Key Functions:
Blocks:
createBlock(title, content, tags)
updateBlock(id, updates)
deleteBlock(id)
getBlocks(filters)
organizeBlocks(folderStructure)
Payloads:
createPayload(name, blocks, config)
updatePayload(id, updates)
deletePayload(id)
getPayloads()
createResponseBlock(payloadName)
Workflows:
createWorkflow(name, payloads)
updateWorkflow(id, updates)
deleteWorkflow(id)
getWorkflows()

3.4 Execution Controller (controllers/executionController.js)
Purpose:
 Handles the orchestration of workflow execution and communication with LLMs.
Key Functions:
executeWorkflow(workflowId): Orchestrate the sequential execution of payloads.
sendToLLM(payload, port): Manage sending payload content to the specified LLM instance.
processResponse(response, payloadId): Process and store LLM responses.
handleExecutionError(error, context): Implement error handling and retry mechanisms.
checkDependencies(payload): Ensure payload dependencies are met before execution.

3.5 Log Controller (controllers/logController.js)
Purpose:
 Manages logging, system messages, and data export.
Key Functions:
logSystemMessage(message, level): Log various system events (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
logLLMInteraction(request, response, metadata): Record detailed LLM communication data.
broadcastStatus(status): Use WebSockets to broadcast status updates to the front-end.
exportRunData(runId): Provide functionality to export run details (e.g., to a text file).

3.6 Frontend Components
3.6.1 index.html (public/index.html)
Responsibilities:
Serve as the single-page interface for the application.
Provide tab navigation for:
Block Manager
Payload Builder
Workflow Executor
Run/Response Viewer
Set up the WebSocket connection for real-time updates.
3.6.2 Front-End Logic (public/js/app.js)
Responsibilities:
Handle UI interactions such as tab switching and form submissions.
Process WebSocket messages and update the UI in real-time.
Manage state and perform client-side validations.
Key Modules/Classes:
TabManager: Controls tab navigation and content display.
FormHandler: Manages form validation and submission logic.
WebSocketHandler: Handles establishing and maintaining the WebSocket connection.
UIUpdater: Updates the DOM based on data changes and user interactions.
3.6.3 API Communication (public/js/api.js)
Responsibilities:
Encapsulate all API calls to the backend.
Manage HTTP requests for blocks, payloads, workflows, and runs.
Handle API responses and errors, with retry strategies if needed.

4. Data Flow
4.1 Block Creation Flow
User Action (Form Submission)
    ↓ (app.js: FormHandler)
AJAX Call (api.js: makeRequest to /blocks)
    ↓ (server.js routes → resourceController.js)
Database Write (config/db.js: executeQuery)
    ↓ (Confirmation)
WebSocket Update (logController.js broadcasts status)
    ↓ (Real-time UI update in app.js)

4.2 Workflow Execution Flow
User Initiates Execution (via Workflow tab)
    ↓ (app.js: Capture Execution Request)
AJAX Call (api.js sends request to /execute)
    ↓ (server.js routes → executionController.js)
Payloads Sent to LLM (sendToLLM) on designated port(s)
    ↓ (LLM generates a response)
Response Processed (processResponse in executionController.js)
    ↓ (Database updated via config/db.js)
WebSocket Broadcast (execution progress/status updates)
    ↓ (Real-time UI updates on workflow progress)


5. Error Handling
5.1 Server-Side Error Handling
Global Middleware:
 Catch-all error middleware in server.js ensures unhandled errors are logged and sent to the client in a sanitized manner.
Controller-Specific Handling:
 Each controller implements error checks and logs detailed context using logController.js.
Database Transaction Management:
 Ensure that database operations are wrapped in transactions where necessary, with rollback on failure.
Retry Logic:
 In executionController.js, include mechanisms to retry LLM communications on transient failures.
5.2 Client-Side Error Handling
API Error Handling:
 api.js catches HTTP errors and displays user-friendly messages.
Form Validation:
 app.js ensures inputs are validated before sending to the server.
WebSocket Reconnection:
 Implement logic to attempt reconnection if the WebSocket connection is lost.
UI Error States:
 Provide visual feedback (alerts, modals) for any critical errors encountered.

6. Security Considerations
Local Environment Security:
Ensure proper file permissions for the SQLite database.
Sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection or XSS.
Limit port access and secure WebSocket connections.
LLM Communication:
Validate requests before sending to LLM instances.
Sanitize responses from LLM to avoid injecting untrusted content.
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, even in a local context.

7. Performance Considerations
Database Performance:
Use connection pooling to manage SQLite connections efficiently.
Optimize SQL queries and create indexes for frequently queried fields.
Manage transactions carefully to maintain data integrity without locking.
Frontend Performance:
Optimize DOM updates and minimize reflows during real-time updates.
Batch WebSocket messages if possible to reduce UI churn.
Cache static resources (HTML, CSS, JS) to speed up load times.
